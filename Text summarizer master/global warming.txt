The earth is burning. And we are the reason behind it. An unprecedented rise in the global atmospheric temperature on earth can be termed as global warming. The average temperature on earth has increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius since the last decade. Global warming is not a single phenomenon; rather, a series of interlinked events that fuel the ultimate rise in global temperatures. It has a plethora of effects across different levels of the ecosystem. In some parts of the world, the effect is negligible, while in others, the effect is significant. Burning of fossil fuel and respiration by animals releases gases like carbon dioxide that escapes into the atmosphere.The heat rays reflecting from the surface of the earth get trapped in the atmosphere because of the carbon dioxide present in it. This is known as the ‘greenhouse effect.’ It is necessary to prevent our planet from becoming a frozen ball. But excessive carbon dioxide retains all the heat emanating from the earth’s surface, leading to global warming. The main gases responsible for global warming are known as greenhouse gases.The chief greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. These gases, when present in unbalanced amounts, result in global warming. Global warming can wipe out the entire human population from the surface of the earth and therefore, must be curbed at the earliest. While the damage cannot be reversed, we can ensure that the effects are controlled to some extent. The first thing we need to do is lead a mass afforestation drive. Next, we can shift from conventional sources of energy like petroleum to cleaner ones like solar and wind energy.
